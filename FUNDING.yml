    # PayPal donation button is superior to a paypal.me link because it
    # additionally:
    #   - accepts credit cards without a need to create a PayPal account
    #   - allows monthly subscriptions (requires a PayPal account)

    # GitHub doesn't allow using URIs in FUNDING.yml, so instead of using a
    # Bitcoin URI we have to resort to using a blockchain explorer link.
    #
    # Blockstream has zero ads on its page, so let's use that, I guess. I have
    # to trust them not to redirect this page to someone else's wallet as a
    # person donating would likely copy the address off the Blockstream web page
    # rather than from the URL GitHub shows the user.
